## [**Potential User Persona Profiles**]()

![1736021677035](image/README/1736021677035.png)


After the interview, the user profiles were categorised into four groups:

- Students - who are more interested in obtaining educational resources and asking questions. The corresponding needs of this group include viewing resources, querying resources, commenting on resources,
  and bookmarking resources.It's worth noting that comments are supposed to be reliable, which is user feedback given by tutor John after the demo. Relevant details will be described in detail at the
  iteration.
- Teachers - whose main need is to view some educational resources for lessons or to enhance their professional competence.The needs of this demographic are primarily to view resources, reviews, and discuss information with people who are also teachers.
- Volunteers - whose main purpose is to provide educational resources to remote areas and schools or to provide assistance to people in need. The main needs of this group are to upload and manage resources and to give help to those who need it.
- Administrators - assist in managing the site's users, user behaviour and resources.The main needs of this group should be to manage resources, users and reviews.

# Components and Modules

Project in the form of functional components to develop each function individually, each function is a separate module does not affect each other, combined together to support the entire project.

The development is divided into three modules: login-signup, Content, and administrator. The login-signup module contains the functions: register, login, and forget password. The pages involved are the login page signup page forget password page. Functions are accessed via buttons on the index page. The administrator module contains manage function for resource user and comment.

Most of the functionality is concentrated in the content module. Search function, upload function, admin function, comment function, reply to comment function. Involved pages modules, student, teacher creator, user, bookmark, news and most importantly content page. Because the Content page is the page that displays the content of each resource, and free access to educational resources is the core goal of the project.


## Details of every function


### Login

Log in with username and password and successfully access the functions you can only access if you are logged in. During the test, the feedback given by the system in different situations is tested by means of equivalent division, and whether the functions that can only be used in the logged-in situation can be used after a successful log-in.

### Upload resource

Upload the appropriate content (file, link and text) by filling in the title, module, topic and selecting the type. When testing, pay attention to whether the file is successfully uploaded, whether the uploaded content is successfully displayed, and whether there is any error reporting.

### Manage

This is achieved by two functions working together: editing content and deleting. The editing function is similar to the uploading function, but the editing function needs to show the original content in the initial state and update the changed part of the content after the change.

### Send review function

There are three pages(Content page, student page, teacher page) that cover the entire function, which is to send a comment out and this can be replied to, or it can be a secondary or tertiary comment that
replies to another comment.
